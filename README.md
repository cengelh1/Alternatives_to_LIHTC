# Welcome to the code for my Client Project! 

This work was done as a work product for Abode Communities, and to satisfy requirements for a Masters of Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA. The Python script was written to be able to scrape data about LIHTC applications in California to analyze in a database. Here are some other available components of the project. An executable program that allows affordable housing developers (or anyone) to automatically download CTCAC and CDLAC Applications is available [here](https://github.com/cengelh1/CTCAC_Downloader). 

## Pro Forma Anaylsis 
The pro formas used in this project are Saved in the folder titled "Pro Formas", or can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cengelh1/Alternatives_to_LIHTC/tree/main/Pro%20Formas)

## Datasets
The complete, cleaned datasets are in the folder titled "Datasets" available for download, not to be confused with the "Data" folder, which contains data referenced in the python script. Alternatively they can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cengelh1/Alternatives_to_LIHTC/tree/main/Datasets)
